"""# Pandas

We have seen Numpy in the last section. It is good at performing math operation on 2d-arrays of numbers. But the major drawback is, it cannot deal with heterogenous values. So, Pandas dataframes are helpful in that aspect for storing different data types and referring the values like a dict in python instead of just referring each item with index.

Pandas series are almost same as nd arrays in numpy, with a additional inferencing ability with custom labels like *keys* in a *dictionary* in python.

"""## Lab Brief - Statistical Learning with Python

### Part-1

## Measures of Data

Descriptive Statistcs are measures that summarize important features of data. Producing these descriptive statistics is a common first step to take after cleaning and preparing a dataset for further analysis. Examples are like calculating Mean or Median. In this lab, we will be looking into some of these functions and explore several new ones.

#### Measures of Central Tendency

Whenever you measure things of the same kind, a fairly large number of such measurements will tend to cluster around the middle value. Such a value is called a measure of "Central Tendency". The other terms that are used synonymously are "Measures of Location", or "Statistical Averages".

## Measures of Dispersion

Measures of Dispersion (Spread) are statistics that describe how data varies. Measure of dispersion gives us the sense of how much the data tends to diverge from the central tendency.

Calculate the Inter-Quartile Range(IQR) for `mpg` in the given dataset.

Interquartile range (IQR) is another common measure of spread. IQR is the distance between the 3rd quartile and the 1st quartile.
